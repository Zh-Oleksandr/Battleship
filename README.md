This is the code for an AI that plays battleship by choosing the square in which a ship is most likely to be placed given how many ships there are, what their lengths are, how many ships are not sunk, and whether or not the ships can touch. This is shown on the screen as the highlighted square on the grid and the program allows you to either play against the AI yourself or watch it play against itself. The rules including ship size, amount of each ship, and whether or not they can touch are all customizable in the code.
